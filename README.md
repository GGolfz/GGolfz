### Glad to see you! My name is Wisarut Kitticharoenphonngam. You can call me Golf.

I am a sophomore student in Computer Science, School of Information Technology, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT).

I am interested in Competitive Programming, Website Development both Front-end and Back-end, Application Development on a portable device in terms of native and cross-platform including Data Science, Cybersecurity, Game Development, and Artificial Intelligence.

In addition, I am also interested in System Analysis and Design because I believe that an efficient system and well design in terms of the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) will make people's lives better. And I am interested in video editing, photography, photo editing, and using technology tools such as Microsoft Power Automate to make my life easier.
